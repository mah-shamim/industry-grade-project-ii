## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline tailored for a retail company. It includes the integration of essential DevOps tools and practices to automate Kubernetes cluster deployment, manage Kubernetes resources, and enable observability for effective monitoring.

---

## **Components of the Project**

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Ansible Playbook for Kubernetes Resource Deployment**
#### **Documentation File:** [pipeline-integration.md](pipeline-integration.md)
- **Objective:** Automate the deployment of Kubernetes resources using Ansible.
- **Key Features:**
    - Define Kubernetes manifests as Ansible playbooks.
    - Simplify deployment and management of Kubernetes resources.
    - Automate updates to ensure seamless integration with the CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. **Automating Kubernetes Cluster Deployment Using Terraform**
#### **Documentation File:** [instruction-terraform.md](instruction-terraform.md)
- **Objective:** Provision Kubernetes clusters using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- **Key Features:**
    - Implement `main.tf` to define resources for Kubernetes cluster creation.
    - Use Terraform commands (`init`, `plan`, `apply`) to automate deployment.
    - Ensure consistency and repeatability in cluster setup.

### 3. **Kubernetes Observability: Installing Prometheus and Grafana Using Helm Charts**
#### **Documentation File:** [instruction-monitoring.md](instruction-monitoring.md)
- **Objective:** Enhance Kubernetes cluster observability using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Key Features:**
    - Utilize Helm charts for quick installation and configuration.
    - Monitor cluster health, resource utilization, and performance metrics.
    - Visualize key metrics through Grafana dashboards.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Setting up the Environment**
1. Prepare the infrastructure:
    - Install required tools: Ansible, Terraform, Helm, kubectl.
    - Set up cloud resources for Kubernetes (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
2. Configure access to the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
1. Create Ansible playbooks for Kubernetes resource deployment.
2. Define Terraform configurations for automated Kubernetes cluster setup.
3. Integrate CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) to streamline pipeline execution.

### **Phase 3: Observability and Monitoring**
1. Install Prometheus and Grafana using Helm.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kubernetes components.
3. Design Grafana dashboards for real-time insights.

## **Deliverables**
1. **Ansible Playbooks:** Automate Kubernetes resource deployment.
2. **Terraform Configurations:** Automate cluster provisioning.
3. **Monitoring Setup:** Enable observability using Prometheus and Grafana.
4. **Documentation:** Step-by-step instructions for all components.

## **How to Use**

1. Clone the repository containing all project files.
2. Follow individual documentation for:
    - Ansible Playbook ([pipeline-integration.md](pipeline-integration.md))
    - Terraform Deployment ([instruction-terraform.md](instruction-terraform.md))
    - Monitoring Setup ([instruction-monitoring.md](instruction-monitoring.md))
3. Execute commands as per documentation to deploy resources and monitor the cluster.

---

## **Future Scope**

1. Integrate security tools (e.g., Aqua, Trivy) into the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Extend the monitoring setup to include alerts and notifications.
3. Automate rollbacks in case of deployment failures.
